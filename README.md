# Testing-Lab-P2
second lab demonstrating principles of test-driven development

//Metaphors to help me understand this correctly:

//Fakes are like stunt doubles. They act like the real actor, but they aren't actually the real actor
//Example: a real database is complex and can slow down your tests. A fake database is a lightweight stand-in that helps make your tests simpler and faster.

//Stubs are like reading from a predetermined script, they always respond the same way no matter what
//Example: For example, a method might behave differently based on the current time. Instead of waiting for the right time, you can use a stub to pretend it's the time you want.

//Mocks are like spies. they watch what my code does and report back to me.
//Example: Instead of sending a real email and checking your inbox, you can use a mock to pretend to be the email client.
